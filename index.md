##About Me
Thanks for visiting! I’m a chemistry teacher about to wrap up a new degree in computer science. I love science, numbers, patterns, bikes, real cats, internet cats, gardening, cooking, travelling and building furniture. I’m constantly looking to solve new problems and learn new skills, whether it be designing a program or figuring out how to bring the piece of furniture in my head to life. In the past 2 years, I’ve managed to learn the components of front-end work (HTLML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery), the ins and outs of Java, and the basics SQL, C++, C, and Python all while squeezing in a full time and a part time job. While teaching always has challenges, and while I always look for fresh approaches to what I do, teaching chemistry year in and year out has left me feeling intellectually stagnant. Being back in school has been invigorating and challenging, giving me an outlet for learning that I don’t get in my day to day work. Even though the classes for my degree have given me a solid foundation of programming skills, I know I still have a lot more to learn and that is one of the things I’m most excited about as a begin this career change. 

##Some Projects:

Gas Law Simulator: Simulation for students to explore the effects of changing temperature, pressure, volume, and the amount of gas on one another. Coded in JavaScript and JQuery. [Code](https://aagnelly.github.io/Gas-Law-Simulator/); [Simulation](http://www.owlchemistry.com/gasSimulation.html)

Postfix Evaluator: Java project that implements the use of stacks to convert a postfix expression to an infix expression and calculate the output. [Code](https://aagnelly.github.io/postfix-evaluator/)

Magnetic Poetry: A Java program using the Drag and Drop features of Swing. The program simulates refrigerator poetry magnets, allowing them to drag words into a text field to create a poem. [Code]( https://aagnelly.github.io/Magnetic-Poetry/)

Molar Mass Calculator: A C++ program takes a chemical formula as input and outputs the chemical's molar mass. [Code] (https://aagnelly.github.io/Molar-Mass-Calculator/)

OWL Chemistry: OWL chemistry is a website I made for my students to learn chemistry. It includes quizzes, drag and drop activities, simulations, and other modules to learn about chemistry. [Link](www.owlchemistry.com)
